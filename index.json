Indeed, in such contexts, it has been demonstrated that using multivectors for interpolation between transmitted poses reduces runtime by 16% and bandwidth usage by an average of 50% compared to traditional representation forms (vectors and quaternions); we demonstrate that GA-Unity further enhances runtime performance. Tailored for 3D Conformal Geometric Algebra, GA-Unity also offers an intuitive interface within the Unity game engine, simplifying GA integration for researchers and programmers. By eliminating the need for users to develop GA functionalities from scratch, GA-Unity expedites GA experimentation and implementation processes. Its seamless integration enables easy representation of transformation properties using multivectors, facilitating deformations and interpolations without necessitating modifications to the rendering pipeline. Furthermore, its graphical interface establishes a GA playground for developers within the familiar confines of a modern game engine. In summary, GA-Unity represents a significant advancement in GA accessibility and usability, particularly in collaborative networked environments, empowering innovation and facilitating widespread adoption across various research and programming domains while upholding high-performance standards.","tags":["Computer Science - Graphics"],"title":"Ga-unity: a production-ready unity package for seamless integration of geometric algebra in networked collaborative applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Achilleas Filippidis","Nikolaos Marmaras","Michael Maravgakis","Alexandra Plexousaki","Manos Kamarianakis","George Papagiannakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1719792000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1722011256,"objectID":"b3aa47d7b3cd0c1f558e56b7de1687c4","permalink":"https://kamarianakis.github.io/publication/2024-srs-cgi/","publishdate":"2024-07-26T16:27:36.190574Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-srs-cgi/","section":"publication","summary":"Contemporary progress in the field of robotics, marked by improved efficiency and stability, has paved the way for the global adoption of surgical robotic systems (SRS). While these systems enhance surgeons' skills by offering a more accurate and less invasive approach to operations, they come at a considerable cost. Moreover, SRS components often involve heavy machinery, making the training process challenging due to limited access to such equipment. In this paper we introduce a cost-effective way to facilitate training for a simulator of a SRS via a portable, device-agnostic, ultra realistic simulation with hand tracking and feet tracking support. Error assessment is accessible in both real-time and offline, which enables the monitoring and tracking of users' performance. The VR application has been objectively evaluated by several untrained testers showcasing significant reduction in error metrics as the number of training sessions increases. This indicates that the proposed VR application denoted as VR Isle Academy operates efficiently, improving the robot - controlling skills of the testers in an intuitive and immersive way towards reducing the learning curve at minimal cost.","tags":["Computer Science - Robotics","Computer Science - Graphics"],"title":"Vr isle academy: a vr digital twin approach for robotic surgical skill development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eckhard Hitzer","Manos Kamarianakis","George Papagiannakis","Petr Vašík"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1690761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1722013055,"objectID":"2afc832bc5f8bd12b06c15ee422cfa54","permalink":"https://kamarianakis.github.io/publication/2023-ga-survey-wiley/","publishdate":"2024-07-26T16:57:34.791304Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-ga-survey-wiley/","section":"publication","summary":"This survey introduces 101 new publications on applications of Clifford's geometric algebras (GAs) newly published during 2022 (until mid-January 2023).
