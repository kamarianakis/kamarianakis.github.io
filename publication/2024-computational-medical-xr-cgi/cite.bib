 abstract = {Computational Medical Extended Reality (CMXR), brings together life sciences and neuroscience with mathematics, engineering and computer science. It unifies computational science (scientific computing) with intelligent extended reality and spatial computing for the medical field. It significantly differs from previous "Clinical XR" or "Medical XR" terms, as it is focusing on how to integrate computational methods from neural simulation to computational geometry, computational vision and computer graphics with deep learning models to solve specific hard problems in medicine and neuroscience: from low/no-code/genAI authoring platforms to deep learning XR systems for training, planning, operative navigation, therapy and rehabilitation.},
