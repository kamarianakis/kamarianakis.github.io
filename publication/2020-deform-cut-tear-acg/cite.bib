 abstract = {In this work, we present an integrated geometric framework: "deep- cut" that enables for the first time a user to geometrically and algorithmically cut, tear and drill the surface of a skinned model without prior constraints, layered on top of a custom soft body mesh deformation algorithm. Both layered algorithms in this frame- work yield real-time results and are amenable for mobile Virtual Reality, in order to be utilized in a variety of interactive application scenarios. Our framework dramatically improves real-time user experience and task performance in VR, without pre-calculated or artificially designed cuts, tears, drills or surface deformations via predefined rigged animations, which is the current state-of-the-art in mobile VR. Thus our framework improves user experience on one hand, on the other hand saves both time and costs from expensive, manual, labour-intensive design pre-calculation stages.},
