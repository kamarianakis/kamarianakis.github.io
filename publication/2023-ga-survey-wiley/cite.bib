 abstract = {This survey introduces 101 new publications on applications of Clifford's geometric algebras (GAs) newly published during 2022 (until mid-January 2023). The selection of papers is based on a comprehensive search with Dimensions.ai, followed by detailed screening and clustering. Readers will learn about the use of GA for mathematics, computation, surface representations, geometry, image, and signal processing, computing and software, quantum computing, data processing, neural networks, medical science, physics, electric engineering, control and robotics.},
