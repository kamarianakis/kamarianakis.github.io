 abstract = {In computer graphics (CG) education, the challenge of finding modern, versatile tools is significant, particularly when integrating both legacy and advanced technologies. Traditional frameworks, often reliant on solid, yet outdated APIs like OpenGL, limit the exploration of cutting-edge graphics techniques. To address this, we introduce pyGANDALF, a unique, lightweight, open-source CG framework built on three pillars: Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, Python programming, and WebGPU integration. This combination sets pyGANDALF apart by providing a streamlined ECS design with an editor layer, compatibility with WebGPU for state-of-the-art features like compute and ray tracing pipelines, and a programmer-friendly Python environment. The framework supports modern features, such as Physically Based Rendering (PBR) capabilities and integration with Universal Scene Description (USD) formats, making it suitable for both educational demonstrations and real-world applications. Evaluations by expert users confirmed that pyGANDALF effectively balances ease of use with advanced functionality, preparing students for contemporary CG development challenges.},
